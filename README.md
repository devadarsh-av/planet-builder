# Planet Builder

A game/simulation for building and customizing planets.

## About

Planet Builder is an interactive simulation that allows users to create and customize their own planets. Experiment with different parameters and watch your planet come to life.

## Features

- Interactive planet creation
- Customizable planet parameters
- Real-time simulation
- [Add more features as you develop them]

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 16 or higher recommended)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/planet-builder.git
cd planet-builder

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Usage

```bash
# Start the development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run tests
npm test
```

## Development

This project is built with JavaScript and leverages modern web technologies for 3D rendering and simulation.
